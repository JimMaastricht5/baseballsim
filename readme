This is a baseball simulator built using Python 3, numpy, and pandas.  The sim uses 2022 baseball stats by default,
but the data can be randomized using bbstats.py to create a custom stats file as input.

Running bbgame.py will run a single game with two teams.  The default teams are MIL and MIN, but that can be changed
by changing the code in at the bottom of the file.  bbgame also accepts the number of simulations to run for a signle
game.  Run the program from the console using python bbgame.py

enhancement list:
1. turn the parameters into arguments so this can be run from the command line

Running bbseason.py will run an entire season of baseball of 162 games with every team.  This takes about 30 minutes.
One can also set the only NL boolean to true to limit the season to just one league (only_nl_b = True) or adjust the
number of games with the variable (num_games).  Random data can be used in place of the MLB data by setting the
random_data flag to True.  Run a season from the command line using python bbseason.py

enhancement list:
1. turn the parameters into arguments so this can be run from the command line
2. allow for the import of pre-randomized data
3. add a pause in the season that allows for the users to specify a number of games before output their teams record
4. add a .... before output their teams stats
5. add a minor league affiliate for each team
